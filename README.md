# agarDQNbot
Trying to implement Agar bot with DQN

## To do (Coming soon, hopefully :D)

- [ ] Write down Readme
  - [ ] Motivation
  - [ ] Idea of project
    - [ ] how it works
    - [ ] Necessery changes to OgarII and Cigar
    - [ ] much more
  - [ ] Instalation
    - [ ] Prerequisites
    - [ ] Install using pip
  - [ ] How to run project
  - [ ] Future of the project
- [ ] Examples of running project 
- [ ] Necessery bug fixes
  - [ ] There are a lot of them probably

- [ ] Future development
  - [x] Moving enviroment to stable-baselines? (Maybe My DQN agent is not working) 
  - [ ] Create own client based on Ws socket
    * Instead of images, it will get just server info by sockets
    * Maybe applicatble to normal Agar servers

## Install 
* virtualenv
* source bin/activate
* pip install selenium
* pip install mss
* pip install tensorflow==1.15
* pip install opencv-python
* pip install stable-baselines

Check by running ***python EnviromentAgar.py***

Somethimes node server is left running, so use ***killall node*** to kill server or client
